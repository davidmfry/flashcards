# React Native Flashcards
This project was created with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

The Flash Card App is my final project for section 4 of the Udacity React Nanodegree program. The Flash card app uses react native and redux for state management. The Flash cards app allows a user to create decks of flash cards for studying. The user has the ability to create a new deck of cards and add new questions to a specific deck. Each deck has a quiz build in. At the end of the quiz you will be given a score on how the user did. If the users has not taken a quiz recently a notification will pop up to remind them to take a quiz. This app also uses asyncStorage on the device to allow the new decks to persist when the app is shut down.

This app has only been tested on iOS devices. There may be some errors if you are viewing on an android device.
